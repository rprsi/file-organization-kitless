# Specify folder path to operate on: For Mac as example, to operate on files in Downloads/r24 folder, set folder variable on line 11 to 'Users/your_username/Downloads/r24'

# Specify number of characters to keep: To keep 2 characters, set keep_length variable on line 13 to 2

# Specify keep direction: Set to 'front' for forward direction, 'back' for backward direction on line 14 with keep_direction variable  

# If original filenames are '1234.png' and '5678.jpg', with keep_length = 2 and keep_direction = 'front', final names will be '12.png' and '56.jpg'. If keep_direction is set to backward, final names will be '34.png' and '78.jpg'
